This lab is a JavaScript refresher. To complete the lab:



Watch the following video tutorial about Programming Basics - How to start programming? (While making a Rock-Paper-Scissors Game)
Use jsbin.com to write and test your script if you like.
Use the prompt() function to ask the user to choose ROCK, PAPER, or SCISSORS and store their response as userSelection
Use the Math.random() function to generate a number as computerSelection: 0 - .34 => PAPER, .35 - .67 => SCISSORS, .68 - 1 => ROCK
Display both the userSelection and computerSelection variables using console.log() - Use decision structures to determine who wins the game using regular Rock, Paper, Scissors rules (ask if you are unclear)
Display the winner of the game ("User Wins", "Computer Wins", or "It's a tie")
When your game is working, copy your completed code into a file called lab1.js
Create a new private GitHub repo called COMP2068, invite me - eduardojaime - as a collaborator and push your lab1.js file to this repo - Submit your COMP2068 repo link
