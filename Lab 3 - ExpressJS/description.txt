In this lab you will use the Express Generator to create a simple web site.

- Use the Express Generator to create a new site called lab3
- Create a new ejs template for each member of your nuclear family (you, each parent, each sibling)
- Create a shared header that has a link with the name of each family member including yourself (e.g. Ethel | Harold | Paul | Rich )
- Each link loads a page with the name of that person (e.g. http://localhost:3000/ethel) 
- Each page shares the same header.ejs file
- Add routing to your routes/index.js file so each link loads the ejs template containing some information about the selected family member.  For example:

Ethel is a retired computer programmer who started her career at IBM in the 1960's.  At IBM she had to keep her wedding ring at home in order to maintain her job. She loves growing roses and is a fantastic baker.
